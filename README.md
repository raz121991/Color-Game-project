# Color-Game-project
Color game project created with HTML CSS and JS
The goal of the game is to guess the right square color which is defined by the header RGB value (0-255,0-255,0-255).
There are two modes for the game: Easy and Hard mode.
Where Easy mode allows you to choose between 3 squares, Hard mode allows you to choose between 6.
